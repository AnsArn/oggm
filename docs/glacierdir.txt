Glacier working directories
===========================

The majority of OGGM tasks are so-called "entity tasks". They
are standalone operations to be realized on one single glacier entity. These
tasks are executed sequentially: they often rely on input data
generated by the previous task(s).

In order to avoid complicated chains of arguments, each task will read the
data it needs out of a specific directory and writes its output into the
same directory, making the new data available for further computations.

These data files and their names are standardized and listed in the ```oggm
.conf`` module. If you want to implement your own task you'll have to add an
entry to this file too.
