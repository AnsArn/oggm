ITMIX Experiment 2016
=====================

Date: 11.03.2016

OGGM participates to the `ITMIX`_ experiment organised by the IACS
`Working Group`_ on Glacier Ice Thickness Estimation.

.. _Working Group: http://www.cryosphericsciences.org/wg_glacierIceThickEst.html

The idea is to provide a distributed estimate of ice thickness for 18
glaciers worldwide.

The glaciers are heterogeneous: valley glaciers, ice-caps,
marine-terminating fronts...

The deadline for the experiment was February 29th. Definitely too early
for OGGM, with which we had performed the inversion for the European Alps
only. We still didn't want to miss this opportunity and started an
intense `development phase`_ to make OGGM applicable globally. After two
weeks of intense work we are now able to provide an estimate for all
glaciers except Antarctica. While this surely marks an important step in the
development of OGGM, this project again raised many questions and research
ideas, since (as you will see below), nothing is easy when doing global
scale distributed modelling.
