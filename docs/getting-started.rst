Getting started
===============

A good place to start is the ``oggm/docs/notebooks`` directory. You will find
two notebooks:

- ``getting_started.ipynb``, which set-ups an entire OGGM run
  in the Ã–tztal region.
- ``flowline_model.ipynb``, which describes the usage of the flowline model
  for idealized test cases.
